# Order Summary Component

This project is an Order Summary component built as part of a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The component displays a summary of a user's subscription plan, including details such as the plan name, price, and options to proceed to payment or cancel the order. It is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, with hover effects and interactive elements.

## Features

- **Order Summary Card**: Displays a summary of the subscription plan, including the plan name, price, and options to proceed to payment or cancel the order.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects on buttons and links for better user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The card is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **SVG Icons**: Uses SVG icons for the music icon and background patterns.
- **Google Fonts Integration**: Utilizes the "Red Hat Display" font from Google Fonts for a modern and clean typography.
